## üîå API
[Ranking data (already uploaded to the image-hosting)](https://cloud.mokeyjay.com/pixiv/?r=api/pixiv-json) (recommended)  
[Ranking data (pixiv url)](https://cloud.mokeyjay.com/pixiv/?r=api/source-json)

`data` is the ranking data; `date` is the ranking date (maybe yesterday or the day before yesterday, depending on the pixiv update time)  

Both API automatically return the corresponding cross-domain header based on the `Origin` or `Referer` in the request header. They are front-end ready.

> The `image` and `url` keys are for compatibility with users of 4.x and earlier versions, you can ignore them
