## ü™Ñ API
[Ranking data (already uploaded to the image-hosting)](https://cloud.mokeyjay.com/pixiv/?r=api/pixiv-json) (recommended)  
[Ranking data (official url)](https://cloud.mokeyjay.com/pixiv/?r=api/source-json)

`data` is the ranking data; `date` is the ranking date (maybe yesterday or the day before yesterday, because the official update time is not necessarily)  
Both api automatically return the corresponding cross-domain header based on the `Origin` or `Referer` in the request header. They can be called directly by the front-end

> The `image` and `url` keys are for compatibility with users of 4.x and earlier versions, you can ignore them
